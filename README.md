  The Gaming Room client is the creator of the game, Draw it or Lose it. Their requirements were to turn their current version of their application game into a web based service. This game should be accessible on all platforms onn the web. This web game is a game based on the original television show Draw it or Lose it in which players can play against each other or in this case, against the computer. 
    What I did particularly well in developing this documentation is researching all the different operating platforms to make sure the game is well adapted to work on all platforms. Different operating platforms such as UNIX, windows, Macintosh and mobile platforms all have major and minor differences that are crucial to understand in the game's development. 
    Working through a design document when developing the code was extremely helpful because when working through the code I was able to stay on task on what was needed to code exactly.
    User's needs are always the most crucial to implement when designing a program. To call a program successful, it should be intuitive, fast and secure for a user. Safety and security for the user was one of the most important aspects to consider when designing the game. User's of the game are trusting when using this application, that their informatio will remain secure and therefore this was the most impportant aspect of the design.
